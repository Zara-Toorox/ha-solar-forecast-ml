# ============================================================================
# MIGRATION NOTES:
# ============================================================================
#
# WHAT WAS REMOVED:
# - _get_state_history() - Blocking Recorder DB access
# - calculate_peak_production_time() - 14-day history analysis
# - All HomeAssistant Recorder imports and dependencies
# - Executor jobs for synchronous history queries
#
# WHAT TO USE INSTEAD:
# - Peak Time: Use ML hourly samples or default 12:00
# - Historical Data: Use DataManager prediction_history.json
# - Monthly Stats: Use DataManager get_average_monthly_yield()
#
# BENEFITS:
# - Zero startup blocking
# - No database load
# - Faster, more reliable
# - Independent of Recorder configuration
#
# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
# - Analyze hourly_samples.json for peak time patterns
# - Use weather_forecast_history.json for correlations
# - ML-based peak time prediction from training data
