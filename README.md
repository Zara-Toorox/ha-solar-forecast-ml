Imagine your smart home not just reacting, but **predicting** - using machine learning that adapts daily to your unique solar installation. That's exactly what **Solar Forecast ML** does, and with Version 6 "Risa" we reach a new dimension of precision.

## What Makes This Integration Special?

Unlike simple weather API services, Solar Forecast ML **learns from your real data**. This means: The longer the integration runs, the more accurate the predictions become - adapted to your specific roof orientation, local weather conditions, shading, and even seasonal characteristics.

### Core: Self-Learning ML Model

The integration collects daily weather data and compares it with your actual solar yield. Through advanced machine learning algorithms, it recognizes patterns and continuously optimizes its predictions. The result? **Precise forecasts that are better than any weather service alone.**

## Features at a Glance

### 📊 Core Functions
- **Daily yield forecasts** for today and tomorrow with automatic ML optimization
- **Hourly predictions** for detailed planning (optional)
- **Intelligent weather integration** with automatic fallback on DWD failures
